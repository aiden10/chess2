Chess but different pieces have different abilities.

Attacking:
    Pieces will have health points instead of "killed" instantly like in regular chess.
    When a piece is attacked, the attacked piece will counterattack if the attacker is in its range.
    Piece HP can be shown with "hp/max_hp" above or on them. It should be slightly transparent and fully opaque when hovered over.

    When hovering over another piece it should also show you the expected amount of HP that will be lost.
    The piece that will be attacked should pulse red and if the current piece will be counterattacked it should also 
    pulse red.

    - Primaries and ultimates 
        Players select the piece they want to move/use
        Then they select the ability they want to use from the side bar
        Then the board will be highlighted to show the valid tiles for that ability
