Make pieces movable
    In draw_board:
        if GameState.selected_piece:
            var movable_tiles: Array[Vector2i] = GameState.selected_piece.can_move_to()
            if Vector2i(row, col) in movable_tiles:
                tile.color = Constants.VALID_TILE_COLOR    
    
    In on_tile_clicked:
        if GameState.selected_piece:
            if Vector2i(row, col) in GameState.selected_piece.can_move_to():
                ## Update board to the new piece's position
                BoardState.board[row][col] = GameState.selected_piece

Attack logic
    If there is a non friendly piece in the valid move positions, it can be attacked
    Add a function to the Piece class to get the attackable tile positions (Vector2i array)
    selection_handler():
        ## Can attack the selected piece
        if GameState.selected_piece and other_piece:
            if Vector2i(row, col) in GameState.selected_piece.attack_targets():
                var dead = other_piece.take_damage(GameState.selected_piece.strength)
                if dead:
                    ## Move the attacker to the dead piece's position
                    BoardState.board[row][col] = GameState.selected_piece
                    GameState.selected_piece.position = Vector2i(row, col)

                if GameState.selected_piece.position in other_piece.attack_targets():
                    var attacker_dead = GameState.selected_piece.take_damage(other_piece.strength)
                    if attacker_dead:
                        GameState.board[GameState.selected_piece.position.x][GameState.selected_piece.position.y] = null
