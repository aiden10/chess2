Attack logic
    While a piece is selected, its attackable tiles are shown colored red. If a piece is in one of the attackable tiles, it should pulse reddish, going from
    transparent and opaque.
    If you then hover over one of those attackable pieces, your selected piece will appear pulsing transparent and opaque in the position it would move to
    to attack the enemy hovered piece. 
    If the attacker is also in the attacked piece's attack_targets, then the attacker will pulse reddish and transparent to opaque.

Roguelike mode:
    Battles take place in what I currently have.
    "Outer world" is grid based and there will be various rooms with items, shops, npcs, bosses, and enemies.
    Navigation in the outer world will be "turn based" like traditional roguelikes.
    When you interact with an enemy it takes you into the battle scene.
    Enemies will have different piece configurations and different abilities/relics on their pieces.
    Players can obtain passive items, or "relics" from item rooms, enemies, bosses, shops, or npcs.
    Players can also obtain abilities from the same places they would obtain relics.
    Before a battle, players can assign abilities that they obtain to their pieces.
    A players pieces all start with no abilities.
