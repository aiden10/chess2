Make pieces movable
    In draw_board:
        if GameState.selected_piece:
            var movable_tiles: Array[Vector2i] = GameState.selected_piece.can_move_to()
            if Vector2i(row, col) in movable_tiles:
                tile.color = Constants.VALID_TILE_COLOR    
    
    In on_tile_clicked:
        if GameState.selected_piece:
            if Vector2i(row, col) in GameState.selected_piece.can_move_to():
                ## Update board to the new piece's position
                BoardState.board[row][col] = GameState.selected_piece

Add attack ranges for all pieces
Figure out how to incorporate that into the attack logic

Attack logic
    If there is a non friendly piece in the valid move positions, it can be attacked
    Add a function to the Piece class to get the attackable tile positions (Vector2i array)
    selection_handler():
        ## Can attack the selected piece
        if GameState.selected_piece and other_piece:
            if Vector2i(row, col) in GameState.selected_piece.attack_targets():
                var dead = other_piece.take_damage(GameState.selected_piece.strength)
                if dead:
                    ## Move the attacker to the dead piece's position
                    BoardState.board[row][col] = GameState.selected_piece
                    GameState.selected_piece.position = Vector2i(row, col)

                if GameState.selected_piece.position in other_piece.attack_targets():
                    var attacker_dead = GameState.selected_piece.take_damage(other_piece.strength)
                    if attacker_dead:
                        GameState.board[GameState.selected_piece.position.x][GameState.selected_piece.position.y] = null
    
    While a piece is selected, its attackable tiles are shown colored red. If a piece is in one of the attackable tiles, it should pulse reddish, going from
    transparent and opaque.
    If you then hover over one of those attackable pieces, your selected piece will appear pulsing transparent and opaque in the position it would move to
    to attack the enemy hovered piece. 
    If the attacker is also in the attacked piece's attack_targets, then the attacker will pulse reddish and transparent to opaque.

Abilities
    Store abilities in different JSON files which get loaded in a global script.
    Format:
        {
            0 : {
                    "passives": ["name": "name here", "description": "description here", "image": "image_path", "function_name": "function name"],
                    },
            "Rook": {"passives": []},
            ...
        }

    The values will be iterated over and Ability objects will be created:
        passive_ability_dict = {}
        for piece_type, value in passives_json:
            for passive_dict in value:
                var passive = PassiveAbility(value["name"], value["description"], value["image"], value["function_name"])
                passive_ability_dict.update({piece_type: passive})
