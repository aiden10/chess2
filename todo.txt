Attack logic
    While a piece is selected, its attackable tiles are shown colored red. If a piece is in one of the attackable tiles, it should pulse reddish, going from
    transparent and opaque.
    If you then hover over one of those attackable pieces, your selected piece will appear pulsing transparent and opaque in the position it would move to
    to attack the enemy hovered piece. 
    If the attacker is also in the attacked piece's attack_targets, then the attacker will pulse reddish and transparent to opaque.
